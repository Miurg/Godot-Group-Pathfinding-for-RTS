# Godot Group Pathfinding for RTS
## ⚠️ Archived / No longer maintained

This is a small, unfinished prototype I created when I first started learning Godot Engine. It was intended as an experimental group pathfinding system for RTS-style games, but the project was never completed and will not be maintained.

## About
Written to explore Godot Engine and GDScript basics.
Simple attempt at handling unit group movement.
Very experimental and messy in places.

# Why keep it public?
Preserved as a personal milestone: my very first Godot project :)
Might help other beginners see one approach (and its limitations).
Shows part of my learning journey.
